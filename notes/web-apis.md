# Web APIs #

* Also called HTTP APIs

* Application Programming Interfaces
    * Interfaces for consumption by applications (in contrast with user interfaces)

* Exposed on the Web
    * Using the Web architecture
    * Using HTTP as the application protocol

* [Growth](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/8000-apis-rise-enterprise/2012/11/26)

* Motivation
    * Multi-platform support
        * "4 screens" (desktop, phone, tablet, TV)
        * Different UIs for the same application        
    * API as the main Product
        * E.g. [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com)
    * Improve functionality (e.g. automation)
        * E.g. Â [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

* [Google API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/)

* Not all APIs have the same evolvability requirements
    * one client, _strongly coupled_ to the API
        * synchronous deployment and evolvability
        * E.g. co-located Single Page Application
    * one client, loosely coupled to the API
        * distinct release cycles
    * multiple clients
        * SPA, Android, iOS
    * unbound clients
        * public APIs
    * multiple servers
        * APIs as specifications
